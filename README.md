- Hi hey, I’m @rtm228
- I’m interested in learning how to code overall. Specifically, I'm interested in learning how to code for data analysis (Python, SQL), generative imagery, and possibly music with coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics, very green to the environment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing currently, not gonna lie.
- 📫 How to reach me: @rtm.228 on Instagram ; ruytobarm@gmail.com
